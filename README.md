Mamba Game Toolkit (MGT) is a sophisticated yet easy-to-use 2D game development library for [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi). Tailored to meet the needs of Windows developers, MGT offers a streamlined approach to building 2D games, focusing on simplicity, performance, and reducing external dependencies. With everything linked directly into the executable️, it eliminates the need for runtime DLLs, simplifying deployment and enhancing the overall stability and reliability of your projects.

This toolkit has been meticulously crafted and tested on Windows 11, utilizing cutting-edge technologies 🛠️ and the latest toolchains to ensure a seamless development experience. It supports Win64 and Unicode, making it highly versatile for projects on Windows 10 and above. By leveraging the latest OS features and enhancements, it delivers a smooth and optimized gaming experience, perfectly suited for modern game development.

The latest version can be downloaded from [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/tinyBigGAMES/mambagametoolkit/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). We recommend checking back often for updates 🔄 and new features as the toolkit evolves 🛠️.

## Features
Mamba Game Toolkit offers a comprehensive suite of features for 🕹️ game development, including:

- **📂 IO Support**: Mamba provides out-of-the-box support for Memory, File, and ZipFile IO operations. Additionally, the IO interface allows you to create custom IO handlers that can be passed to methods supporting the IO interface, providing flexibility for handling various data sources, whether they're from memory, files, or custom streams.

- **🔗 Direct Linking of Dependencies**: No runtime DLLs! All C dependencies 🛠️, such as `GLFW`, `cute_headers`, `stb`, `minizip`, and `pl_mpeg`, are compiled into a single object file (`Mamba.Deps.o`) and linked directly into your Delphi executable using `{$L Mamba.Deps.o}`. This approach eliminates the need for external DLLs, reduces deployment headaches 🤕, and minimizes interference from antivirus software 🛡️, making your game more secure and easier to distribute.

- **🖼️ Graphics and Video**:
  - 🎨 Texture management, color manipulation, and rendering of geometric shapes.
  - 📽️ Video playback support for MPEG-1 videos, seamlessly integrated with the toolkit, allowing you to add rich multimedia experiences to your games.

- **🎵 Audio**:
  - 🎶 Background music and sound effects, supporting multiple formats to enhance the immersive quality of your game.
  - 🔊 Control over volume, looping, and playback position for detailed sound design, giving you the tools needed to create an engaging audio experience.

- **🕹️ Input Handling**:
  - ⌨️ Keyboard, 🖱️ mouse, and 🎮 gamepad support to cater to a wide range of input devices. This ensures that your games are accessible and intuitive for users, no matter their preferred control method.

- **🖥️ Console Output**:
  - Extensive control over console output, including cursor positioning ➡️, color manipulation 🌈, and text formatting ✍️. This can be particularly useful for debugging 🐞 or creating in-game console features.

- **📐 Math Utilities**:
  - ➗ Vector math, easing functions, collision detection 💥, and various geometric utilities 📏. These functions make it easy to handle game physics ⚙️, animations 🎞️, and other calculations required for a smooth gameplay experience.

- **⚡ Optimized Workflow**:
  - Easy setup—just add `Mamba` to your `uses` section, and you're ready to develop! No complex setup steps or configuration needed, allowing you to jump straight into game development with minimal friction.

## Key Benefits
- **🔗 Integrated Dependencies**: Unlike many other game toolkits that require external DLLs, Mamba's dependencies are compiled directly into your executable️, ensuring simplicity and robustness. This eliminates the hassle of managing DLLs during deployment and makes your game more stable and secure.

- **🚀 Performance**: Using the latest clang-based toolchain in Delphi's RAD Studio 12.2, Mamba is built with performance in mind. The toolkit is optimized to ensure that your games run smoothly and efficiently, even on older hardware 🖥️, providing an excellent experience for players.

- **🪟 Windows Focused**: Mamba is optimized for Windows 10 and higher, allowing you to take full advantage of native Windows APIs and modern OS features. This makes Mamba an ideal choice for developers targeting the Windows platform, as it seamlessly integrates with the Windows environment to provide high performance and compatibility.

- **🎮 Full Game Development Suite**: Mamba provides everything from rendering and input to sound and video playback, making it a one-stop solution for your 2D️ game development needs. You don't need to integrate multiple libraries or deal with compatibility issues—Mamba has everything you need in one comprehensive package.

## Example Code
Here's a quick example to demonstrate the ease of use of the Mamba Game Toolkit:

```Delphi
var
  LWindow: IWindow;
  LTexture: ITexture;
  LFont: IFont;
  LPos: TPoint;
  LHudPos: TPoint;
begin
  IGet(IWindow, LWindow);

  LWindow.Open('MGT: Texture #01');

  IGet(IFont, LFont);
  LFont.Load(LWindow, 10);

  IGet(ITexture, LTexture);
  LTexture.LoadFromZipFile(CZipFilename, 'res/images/mgt.png');
  LTexture.SetPos(LWindow.GetVirtualSize().w/2, LWindow.GetVirtualSize().h/2);
  LTexture.SetScale(0.5);

  LPos.x := 0;
  LPos.y := 25;

  while not LWindow.ShouldClose() do
  begin
    LWindow.StartFrame();

      if LWindow.GetKey(KEY_ESCAPE, isWasPressed) then
        LWindow.SetShouldClose(True);

      if LWindow.GetKey(KEY_F11, isWasPressed) then
        LWindow.ToggleFullscreen();

      LPos.x := LPos.x + 3.0;
      if LPos.x > LWindow.GetVirtualSize().w + 25 then
        LPos.x := -25;

      LWindow.StartDrawing();

        LWindow.Clear(DARKSLATEBROWN);

        LTexture.Draw(LWindow);

        LWindow.DrawFilledRect(LPos.x, LPos.y, 50, 50, RED, 0);

        LHudPos := Math.Point(3, 3);

        LFont.DrawText(LWindow, LHudPos.x, LHudPos.y, 0, WHITE, haLeft, '%d fps', [LWindow.GetFrameRate()]);
        LFont.DrawText(LWindow, LHudPos.x, LHudPos.y, 0, WHITE, haLeft, 'ESC - Quit', []);
        LFont.DrawText(LWindow, LHudPos.x, LHudPos.y, 0, WHITE, haLeft, 'F11 - Toggle fullscreen', []);

      LWindow.EndDrawing();

    LWindow.EndFrame();
  end;

  IRelease(LTexture);

  IRelease(LFont);

  LWindow.Close();

  IRelease(LWindow);
end;
```

In this example, we create a window, load a texture, and continuously render it within the game loop until the window is closed. The simplicity of this code demonstrates how Mamba handles the complexities of development, allowing you to focus on the creative aspects.

## API Overview
### 🖥️ Console API
Mamba's console API gives you detailed control over the text-based console output:
